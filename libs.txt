Keanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means " loud {{Animal - Plural}} over the {{noun}} " in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. 

After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the hockey flick Handsome American Actor Teaches our Glorious Leader to Play Hockey (Willingly, Without Any Coercion), which was filmed in North Korea. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves hung up his skates and headed for Hollywood.


His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Karen in Karen & Bill's Excellent Adventure. Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Karen stigma with a series of rugged and manly projects. He played a inquisitive aardvark in My Own Private Idaho.

He is a musician and played bass guitar for the bands Dogstar and Keira.
